# palindromes
This is a palindrome checker written in python. Given a word or a phrase it will check to see if the input is the same backwards as it is forwards. I created it in my first week at The Iron Yard to practice manipulating strings and lists. 

The palindromes.py file is just python code and can be run in the terminal, but I the rest is a Django project I set up to test GET and POST verbs.
